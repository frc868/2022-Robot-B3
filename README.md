# 2022-CommandBased

This is (untested) command based code for the 2022-Robot! Has some fun features like an attempt at trajectory tracking, a new logging system, and a potentially working 5 ball auton. Feel free to peruse this code as you'd like! Do note that some values/constants are set to zero, this is on purpose since nothing is actually tuned or tested.
